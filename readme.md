# Flat Share Service Charge Management System (FSSCMS)
FSSCMS is a hacked-together project designed to assist the main tenant in efficiently managing and tracking utility bills for a shared apartment. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the management of utility bill reimbursements to the roommates based on their individual share of the expenses.

## Features
- **Tenant Management**: The application allows the main tenant to add and manage the roommates' information, including their names and move-in/move-out dates.
- **Utility Cost Tracking**: You can record your (changing) utility costs, including electricity, water, heating, and other related expenses. If something changes just add the new costs with their new date and from that point on the system will use them for calculations, while still using the old costs for the period before.
- **Expense Allocation**: The system calculates each roommate's share of the utility bills based on predefined rules or custom percentages.
- **Billing Management**: The application enables the main tenant to input and manage the details of each utility bill, including the billing period and the total amount.
- **Reimbursement Calculation**: The system generates accurate reimbursement amounts for each roommate, taking into account their share of the utility bills and any pending payments.

Please note that this project is a hacked-together solution and may not have all the features and robustness of a fully developed application.
